# Gauss quadrature
This project provides fast algorithms for computing Gauss-Jacobi (Gauss-Legendre as a particular case), Gauss-Laguerre and Gauss-Hermite quadratures together with Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto variants. In addition to Matlab algorithms, arbitrary precision Maple algorithms are provided for the symmetric cases (Gauss-Gegenbauer and Hermite). ººººººº  
The algorithms are described in the paper "Fast and accurate computation of classical gaussian quadartures"
